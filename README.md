# HandMeDownPi
I originally wanted to build a raspberry pi camera. However, I am still on a budget. 

So I will be creating a device that helps me with everyday tasks. Tasks may include media viewing, calculator, retro gaming, small storage device.


Why am I building this?
I am building this is because I am on my phone more than I should be.
