# HandMeDownPi
I want to create a portable camera, which can aid me on holiday. Basic functions include taking photos and recording videos. However, I have noticed that work or some family matter tends to find me, even if I am on holiday. So I will also be implementing a work mode.  The work mode will function as a desktop allowing me to do productive times.  This way, if I am on holiday, I can write a document if needed.  Lastly, I will be adding a media mode. The TV services provided by hotels often do not fit my taste.  

## What will this project include?
- Camera mode:
- [ ] Taking photos
- [ ] Recording videos
- [ ] Security camera mode (if I have time)
- Work mode:
- [ ] Desktop mode
- Media mode:
- [] Kodi
- [] Desktop viewing mode. 

## Why am I building this?

I am building this is because I am on my phone more than I should be.
